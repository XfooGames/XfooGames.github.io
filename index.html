        <p>XfooGames operates the "MyCar".</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We do not collect any personal data from users of the App. The App does not require any personal information to function, and we do not collect, store, or share any user data.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requires the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE:</strong> This permission allows the app to change Wi-Fi multicast settings, which may be necessary for certain multiplayer features in the future.</li>
            <li><strong>android.permission.INTERNET:</strong> This permission allows the app to access the internet for online features and updates.</li>
            <li><strong>android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS:</strong> This permission allows the app to send notifications to users.</li>
            <li><strong>android.hardware.wifi:</strong> This feature allows the app to utilize Wi-Fi capabilities on the device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>The App uses the device's local storage to save and retrieve data necessary for its functionality. This data is stored only on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties. This data may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Game progress</li>
            <li>User settings and preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is intended for a general audience, including children under 13. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). As such, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such information from our systems.</p>
        <p>Since our App does not collect any personal data, there is no need for parental consent. The local data stored on the device, such as game progress and settings, is not accessible to us and cannot be shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
        <p>We are planning to introduce multiplayer features in the future. These features may require additional permissions, such as accessing Wi-Fi multicast settings, to provide a seamless multiplayer experience. We will update our Privacy Policy to reflect these changes once they are implemented.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
